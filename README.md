# Library-Management-System
Keeping track of all the books and library members is a tedious task to do manually, and may result
in a lot of disorganization. For this reason, we are creating a Library Management System for a
local library. Our system will have all the features necessary to ensure that all managing in the
library happens smoothly and all the data is organized and accessible.
The system is needed to keep track of the books that are in the library and the ones that have been
borrowed. It will keep track of the catalogue of books, the borrowed books and those who borrow
them, as well as those who are library card holders. Everyone who uses the library’s resources will
be kept track of in this way. 

## Intended Use of The System:
Librarians: They can keep track of all the books and where they are currently, to help manage
the library and the members who borrow books.

Library Members/Visitors: They will search the catalogue to check the book’s locations inthe 
library and their availability. The system will keep track of their borrowed and requested books
as well. They can also request and renew their library card

## Main Components of the System:
The system consists of three layers – UI, business logic layer and the database. Separating into these 
layers will help organize the code better. The program itself uses Java for most of the modules, uses 
Scenebuilder for the UI and MySQL for the database. The whole system will be stored on one
computer.
